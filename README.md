# maestro-app
App frontend for the maestro project.

## Developing
To develop with this project, you must have Xcode 8.3 running the default Swift toolchain (not a nightly build). Open `Maestro.xcworkspace`, not `Maestro.xcodeproj` to work - this is a requirement of the Cocoapods dependency manager.
